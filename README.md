## Introduction

This project focuses on detecting violations in real-time from camera feeds. The aim is to provide an automated solution for monitoring and reporting violations using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Features

- **Violation Detection**: Automatically detect various types of violations from camera feeds.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of handling real-time video streams and processing them on the fly.
- **Data Logging**: Logs detected violations with timestamps and relevant details.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip package manager
- Jupyter Notebook

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/camera-violation-detection.git
   cd camera-violation-detection
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**

   Start the application by running the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Camera Violation.ipynb"
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Notebook

- Open the Jupyter Notebook `Camera Violation.ipynb`.
- Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to set up and run the violation detection process.

### Processing Video Streams

- Ensure that the video stream source is correctly set up.
- Run the appropriate cells in the notebook to start detecting violations in real-time.
